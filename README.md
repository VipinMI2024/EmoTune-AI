# 🎵 EmoTune AI - Emotionally Expressive Music Generator

**Powered by Vipin**

**EmoTune AI** is a deep learning project that generates emotionally expressive music based on user-specified emotions. By combining Transformer architectures and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), the system is capable of producing realistic, human-like melodies tailored to moods such as *happy*, *sad*, *angry*, *relaxed*, and more.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 🎶 **Emotion-Based Music Generation**: Input a target emotion and generate music reflecting that mood.
* 🤖 **Transformer + GAN Hybrid Architecture**: Leverages the sequence modeling power of Transformers with the creative synthesis of GANs.
* 🧠 **Human-Like Melodies**: Produces high-quality, expressive compositions in MIDI or audio format.
* 🎛️ **User Control Panel**: Easily customize emotion intensity, tempo, genre influences, and more.
* 📊 **Training on Emotion-Tagged Datasets**: Utilizes publicly available emotion-labeled music datasets for training and evaluation.


## 🧠 Model Architecture

* **Emotion Encoder**: A Transformer-based module that encodes the emotion input into a latent representation.
* **GAN Generator**: Takes emotion vectors and random noise to generate expressive musical sequences.
* **Discriminator**: Evaluates whether the music is realistic and aligned with the given emotion.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/EmoTune-AI.git
cd EmoTune-AI
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🛠️ Usage

```python
from models import generate_melody

emotion = "joyful"
melody = generate_melody(emotion=emotion, tempo=120)
save_to_midi(melody, filename="joyful_tune.mid")
```

Or via Web Interface (Streamlit):

```bash
streamlit run app/ui_interface.py
```

## 📊 Dataset

We use emotion-labeled MIDI datasets such as:

* EMOPIA: A Multi-Genre Dataset for Emotion-Controlled Piano Music Generation
  📎 [https://github.com/ylab-hi/EMOPIA](https://github.com/ylab-hi/EMOPIA)

* Music Emotion Recognition Dataset (MER)
  📎 [https://zenodo.org/record/4414721](https://zenodo.org/record/4414721)

---

## 🧪 Evaluation

* Emotion classification accuracy of generated samples
* Music quality metrics (tonal stability, pitch range, rhythm variance)
* Human evaluation via listening sessions

---

## 🔍 Future Enhancements

* Support for multi-instrument generation
* Real-time generation with emotion sliders
* Integration of lyrics for deeper emotional context
* Cloud-based API and mobile app deployment
